# Hide Sticky and Promote

Drupal 7 Module that hides the "promote to front page" and "sticky" checkboxes
when creating and editing content. This is to avoid confusion for our users
since we do not use those options.

**Installation:**

  * Install the module as you normally would.  There is no configuration.

**Requirements:**
  * None
